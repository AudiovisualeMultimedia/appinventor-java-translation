App Inventor to Java Translation Tool
=====================================

Overview:
This tool takes App Inventor 'Source' archives as input and produces
Eclipse Android Java projects as output. The produced projects depend on
the App Inventor Java Bridge (libsimpleandroidruntime.jar). This library
provides an API to the Android runtime that closely mimics the API of the
App Inventor standard library. This allows for a direct translation of the
user's App Inventor project into a Java project.

Prerequisites:
* Java
* JDK (required for Eclipse)
* Eclipse
* Android SDK (Platform Version 7/2.1)
* Android ADT (Eclipse Plugin, will automatically install Android SDK)
* The App Inventor Translation Application Jar

Usage:
1) Use the 'Download Source' from the 'More Options' menu after selecting
   your project from App Inventor's 'My Projects' screen. This will cause
   your browser to download a Zip archive containing the App Inventor
   source code for your project.
2) On your system, create a new empty directory for the translation tool
   to put the generated Eclipse Android project into. Convention dictates
   that this directory should have the same name as your App Inventor
   project, but any name should work
3) Run the App Inventor Translation Jar (in Windows or OS X,
   double-click it). Select your project's source archive (Zip) as input.
   Select your empty directory as output. Click 'Convert'. When the
   Application becomes responsive to user input again, translation is
   complete, so long as no error dialogs are presented. You can now close
   the translator
4) Launch Eclipse. Go to File -> Import. Select General/Existing Projects
   into Workspace. The root directory is the translator's output
   directory, so click the browse button and find it. Verify that your
   project is selected in the center pane and click 'Finish'. You are now
   on your own; Your project App Inventor project has been converted to a
   Java project and the translated version is available in Eclipse.

Issues:
* The translator does not have a map of the parameter and return types for
  the App Inventor standard library, so it does not perform necessary
  casting of values. As a result, it is likely that the user will need to
  manually add a great number of casts and conversions in order to get
  their app to compile for the first time. In order to fix this issue,
  someone will have to map the entire App Inventor standard library and
	alter the translator source to consider their map in generating method
	calls

* The translator has issues regarding event handlers that take parameters.
  It is simply not aware of this possibility, so the user has to manually
  add the parameters in order to make the project compile.

* Some properties of GUI components are not transfered over. As an
  example, observe the change in the size of the image of the Android in
  the Toggle_Image sample project
